## R1. Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular app.

In the current Australian economic climate, where the cost of living is currently at an all time high, it has become more prominent than ever for people to start budgeting and reviewing their expenses to implement cost saving measures to maintain their way of life, or to just 'survive'. For simple budgeting, there are a huge variety of budgeting applications or even a simple spreadsheet that can allow people to manage their finances. However, when it comes to shopping and analysing one's own personal shopping habits, there lays a few pain points there that prohibit people from conducting reviews into their shopping patterns and habits which limit their ability to improve their shopping behaviours and thus improve their finances.

Some of these pain points include:

* **Difficulty in manual purchase tracking** - Shoppers struggle in manually keeping track of their shopping purchases due to time constraints and laziness which leads to difficulties in manging their budgets. Without a centralised system for recording their purchase details, shoppers find it difficult to maintain an organised record of their shopping history to make informed decisions when buying products

* **Difficulty in analysing purchase patterns** - Understanding a shopper's own purchasing behaviour is crucial in them making an informed decisions about their future purchases, which then impacts their budgeting. Manually analysing one's purchase patterns from physical and digital receipts that are scattered across different locations and retailers can be very time cosuming and inefficient. Without a dedicated platform to analyse purchase data, shoppers cannot gain valuable insights into their spending habits or identify opportunities where there can save money

* **Missing out on promotion tracking** - Shoppers often miss out on promotions or sales due to a lack of awareness or oversight. There are online websites that provide a platform for shoppers to share countless deals and sales, however this can include products of every size, type and usage, which is not useful for a shopper that knows what their specific needs and interests are in products that they need. Without a systematic way to track promotions across various products and stores that are relevant to the shopper, shoppers will overlook discounts and end up spending more

* **Existing applications that are specific to retailers** - Different retailers have their own applications which allow shoppers to conduct online purchases and view their past orders, purchases and even view their online receipts. However due to the saturated market in the grocery and retail sectors, it becomes too difficult for shoppers to attempt in analysing their shopping behaviour and purchasing patterns due to them needing to review this across the countless number of different applications they would need from each retailer to review their respective purchases from their respective applications.

This Shopping Diary API application aims to address all of the aforementioned pain points by providing shoppers with a comprehensive platform for tracking purchases, analysing spending patterns, and allowing them to set alerts for promotions or sales. By providing these robust features to engage in their own purchase management and purchase analysis, this application seeks to empower users to make informed shopping decisions to optimise their spending habits effectively, and in turn help them save money towards their budgets and finances.


## R2. Why is it a problem that needs solving?

The pain points identified above in R1, which include the problems of difficulty in manual purchase tracking, analysing purchase patterns,  missing out on promotions, and difficulty in managing various retailer-specific apps, all have significant ramifications for individuals and households trying to manage their finances effectively. In detail, they have additional impacts such as:

* **Financial impact** - In today's economic climate, where the cost of living is so high, for families and inividuals every dollar saved counts. Difficulty in manually tracking purchases and analysing spending patterns can lead to overspending, budgetary constraints, and eventually, financial stress. Without insights into their spending habits, individuals may sstruggle to identify areas where they can cut costs and save money, which ultimately hinder their financial stability and their wellbeing.

The Shopping Diary API will offer individuals the ability to track their purchases and analyse their spending habits, which will empower them to understand their spending habits and identify areas for cost-saving measures. By providing individuals with visibility into their finances, they can make informed decisions to optimise their spending and improve their financial stability

* **Time and effort** - Manual tracking of purchases and analysing both physical and online receipts from various sources is extremely time consuming and highly inefficient.

By providing these functionalities through a centralised platform, such as through the Shopping Diary API, it allows for individuals to conduct their purchase tracking and analysis in the one location and allows them to save valuable time to focus on other aspects of their lives

* **Opportunity cost** - For shoppers, missing out on promotions and discounts due to a lack of awareness or oversight represents a huge missed opportunity for savings. In an economic climate where every dollar, and down to the last cent, matters, individuals need tools and solutions that enable them to stay informed about when promotions for products they usually buy go on sale, which helps them make informed purchasing decisions. The Shopping Diary API, through promotion tracking functionalities and alerts, allows them to do this by allowing them to track promotions across various products and stores and set alerts themselves, which allow for individuals to capitalise on saving opportunities and make their money go that one step further

* **Accessibility and convenience** - Existing applications that are specific to retailers creates a fragmentation in the retail app market, which causes inconvenience for users who need to navigate across multiple platforms to analyse their shopping behaviour. The Shopping Diary API addresses this challenge by providing users with a single platform to track their purchases, analye their spending patterns and set alerts for when products they usually purchase go on sale. By doing this, it creates a single point of reference for users and helps them avoid the fragmentation and inconvenience associated with multiple platforms. This enables them to effectively monitor their spending habits and achieve their financial goals.
